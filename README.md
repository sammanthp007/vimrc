# vimrc
## To Use:

### First Setup Vundle
```
git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
```

### Add the file in this repo as your ~/.vimrc
```
git clone
```

### Download and install all the plugins
```
vim +PluginInstall +qall
```

## Some features of VIM I use regularly
### For finding content, in command mode:
```
:find
```

### Using buffers
```
:ls
:b 
```

### For using NERDTree, in normal mode:
```
<F5>
```
